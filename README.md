Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### 🛠 Stack

- **Database**: Designing, data integrity and adherence to normal forms
- **DevOps**: **Docker**, **CI/CD** throught Github Actions

### 🌱 Current focus

### 🌱 Current personal work
- **Meyzieu Gym Artistique**: It's a project for a gym club for kids I've been developing with a colleague of mine. MVP is up and running, still a long way before we implement all the features we've planned. Absolute pleasure to do this for them.

### 🤝 Open to Collaboration
I'm always up for collaborating on new projects. Whether you're looking for a pair programming buddy, need a hand with your project, or have an idea we could work on, just reach out! Always open to new ideas and opportunities!
